# stylin-epub-mangler
a tool for taking epubs (specifically ones downloaded from archiveofourown) and adding some styling to them (specifically ao3 workskins)

[archive of our own](archiveofourown.org) has a convenient feature letting you download entire fics as ebooks. this is really nice because I wanna read them on the train on my tablet (which doesn't have a data plan). however! homestuck fic frequently has pesterlogs in it, which really aren't right if they're not formatted. they don't look right. also it's fucking impossible to read them. see, in pesterlogs, text color is one of the main indicators of who's talking! and so yeah. it's really annoying that we can't keep the css styling. so i wanna make it work :X
